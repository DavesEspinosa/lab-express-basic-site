      <h1>World War II and the Manhattan Project.</h1>
      <p>
        In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist
        Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb
        research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd,
        along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner,
        "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the
        possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic
        bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to
        such a weapon."To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July
        1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe,
        Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic
        bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was
        asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to
        President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its
        own nuclear weapons research.
